HttpFoundation Session Component
========================

In Wordpress development I kept finding myself wanting to use Symfony's Session object without any of the rest of HttpFoundation.

This library includes only the HttpFoundation classes required for handling a session.
 
All of HTTPFoundation is included in these libraries:
  * [pno/request](https://github.com/penoonan/request)
  * [pno/session](https://github.com/penoonan/session)  
  * [pno/bag](https://github.com/penoonan/bag)
  * [pno/file](https://github.com/penoonan/file)
  * [pno/response](https://github.com/penoonan/response)
  * [pno/foundation-tests](https://github.com/penoonan/foundation-tests)
