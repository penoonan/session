HttpFoundation Session Component
========================

In Wordpress development I kept finding myself wanting to use Symfony's Session object without any of the rest of HttpFoundation.

This library includes only the HttpFoundation classes required for handling a session.
 
Note: if you want to use this with Requests, you also need to require "[pno/request](https://github.com/penoonan/request)" in your project.
